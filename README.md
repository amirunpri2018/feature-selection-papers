# Feature Selection Papers
Feature selection plays an important role in text classification. In the process of text classification, each word is considered as a feature which creates a huge number of features. However, one of the most main issue in text classification is high dimensioanl feature space. excessive number of feature increase the computational cost, but also may degrades the accuracy. Therefore, feature selection selects a set of best features for the target. There are mainly four categories for feature selection methods: filter, wrapper, hybrid and embedded.

Here are the list of paper when I was doing research on feature selection.
